      <title>The Business Implications of Combinatorial Optimisation by Deep Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Deep Learning has revolutionised a multitude of technical fields, most notably Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. The implications for business are enormous, with the ramifications of these change still filtering through the mostly technology-shy world of business. There are signs that Combinatorial Optimisation might be the next technical field to undergo Revolution-By-Neural-Network. If this comes to fruition, then the impact on business will be seismic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Bitter Lesson Conditions</title>

      <description>The hard truth of AI is that methods that exploit deep, hard-won human knowledge about a particular domain are outperformed by methods that cleverly exploit the increasing power of computation.
I have a modest proposal to distill this fundamental truth into a set of conditions which, when met, will revolutionise a given field.
Lineage I do not claim this insight about the fundamental mechanism of progress in AI as original; I have been heavily influenced by Richard Sutton&amp;rsquo;s powerful essay The Bitter Lesson.</description>

      <description>I just discovered kops, apparently an excellent way to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on the cloud. Since managing a k8s cluster seems to be a full-time job at the best of times, I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see if this really does make it much easier. I have a very mild case of podcast addiction, and am always looking for something great to add to my collection of subscriptions. Nikita Voloboev has published a very interesting list of podcasts.</description>

      <description>My former colleagues at Blue Yonder (now part of JDA) have introduced Kartothek, software for managing tables stored as parquet files. A great set of documentation on going zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes. A related piece from Jim Crist on installing JupyterHub on an existing Hadoop cluster. An interesting paper interoducing PATE from a couple of years ago that had passed me by. PATE stands for Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, and is a method for doing semi-supervised transfer learning from private data.</description>

      <description>Naftali Tishby on the Information Theory of Deep Learning (embedded below). I&amp;rsquo;m very enthusiastic about this kind of work, and have resolved to find and read more of it. a16z&amp;rsquo;s AI Playbook may be a couple of years old now, but it&amp;rsquo;s still an important read. Traces is a Python library for unevenly-spaced time series analysis. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a problem to really try this out on, but the website looks slick 👌🏻.</description>

      <description> Spektral is a framework for relational representation learning, built in Python and based on the Keras API. The field of Geometric Deep Learning is starting to get some traction. In particular, doing Deep Learning on graphs presents some interesting possibilities. RPC Frameworks: gRPC vs Thrift vs RPyC for python. The state of Python Packaging. Packing in Python is both improving dramatically and harder than it should be.  </description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrislaing.net/blog/keybase-keys-for-everyone-part-i/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io&#34;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt;, a clever company that is solving a lot of the classic problems that users have had with PGP: managing keys, verifying identities, trusting third parties, and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Encryption is a topic that has fascinated me for years, less because of its mathematical basis than its applications, both existing and potential. By far my favourite project in this realm is &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io&#34;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
