      <title>On the Economics and Ergonomics of LLMs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For all the millions of words that have been devoted to the capabilities of LLMs, the economics and ergonomiocs of these systems seems to me to be under-discussed. In much the same way that technology changes - from records to cds to streaming - have been a dominant factor in the evolution of popular music, prosaic matters such as cost structures will have a substantial influence on the development and impact of AI. While it is still early days for LLMs, there are already signs that economics factors are impacting everything from product design and technology choice to adoption and even regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Decomposition of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many AI systems can be very complex, Large Language Models (LLMs) seem to be refreshingly simple to understand. With their ability to generate human-like text, applications like ChatGPT have captured the popular imagination. However, as compelling an experience as chatbots are, the tradeoffs that they make can lead us to misunderstand LLMs as a whole. In this post, we will explore the idea that the functions of LLMs can be thought of as discrete capabilities, and how different composition of these functions leads to a much wider variety of user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Large Language Model Iceberg</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to evolve, the term &amp;ldquo;chatbot&amp;rdquo; has become synonymous with a new era of digital interactions. What was once a seemingly futuristic concept is now an integral part of our everyday lives. However, it is the Machine Learning models underlying them - Large Language Models (LLMs) - that are the true powers in these waters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
