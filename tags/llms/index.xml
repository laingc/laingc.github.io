      <description>&lt;p&gt;While many AI systems can be very complex, Large Language Models (LLMs) seem to be refreshingly simple to understand. With their ability to generate human-like text, applications like ChatGPT have captured the popular imagination. However, as compelling an experience as chatbots are, the tradeoffs that they make can lead us to misunderstand LLMs as a whole. In this post, we will explore the idea that the functions of LLMs can be thought of as discrete capabilities, and how different composition of these functions leads to a much wider variety of user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to evolve, the term &amp;ldquo;chatbot&amp;rdquo; has become synonymous with a new era of digital interactions. What was once a seemingly futuristic concept is now an integral part of our everyday lives. However, it is the Machine Learning models underlying them - Large Language Models (LLMs) - that are the true powers in these waters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
